Project Narrative: Price Comparison Web Application for Small Business Owners
Introduction
Small business owners often struggle to manage costs when sourcing groceries and wholesale goods. To address this, we are developing a web application that empowers users to compare prices across major wholesale retailers like Costco, Sam’s Club, Restaurant Depot, BJs, and Jetro. The app will initially focus on three staple items—eggs, milk, and bread—but is designed to scale to include any product. To ensure accurate and up-to-date pricing, we will use web scraping to gather initial data, combined with user contributions and AI-driven validation for ongoing updates.

This narrative outlines the workflow, development stages, and value proposition of the project for stakeholders, with a focus on leveraging web scraping for initial data collection.

Workflow
1. User Interaction
Search for Products:

Users enter a product name (e.g., “eggs”) or use natural language queries (e.g., “cheap organic milk”).

The app displays a comparison table with prices, units, and retailers.

View Price Trends:

Users can access AI-generated price trend predictions (e.g., “Egg prices are expected to rise next week”).

Submit Price Updates:

Users can contribute price updates by entering data manually or uploading receipts.

AI validates submissions for accuracy and flags anomalies.

Personalized Recommendations:

Based on user behavior, the app suggests deals or retailers for frequently purchased items.

Chatbot Assistance:

Users can ask questions like, “Where’s the cheapest milk today?” via an AI-powered chatbot.

2. Data Flow
Initial Data Collection via Web Scraping:

Scrape prices for eggs, milk, and bread from Costco, Sam’s Club, and other retailers.

Standardize units (e.g., price per dozen eggs, price per gallon of milk).

Store scraped data in the database, flagged as non-user-submitted.

Ongoing Data Updates:

Users submit price updates, which are validated by AI and stored in the database.

Regularly re-scrape retailer websites to refresh prices and cross-verify user submissions.

Data Processing:

AI models standardize units, detect anomalies, and generate price trends.

NLP models process natural language queries to match products in the database.

Data Display:

Processed data is displayed in a user-friendly comparison table.

AI-generated insights (e.g., price trends, recommendations) are highlighted.
