# Price Comparison Web Application for Small Business Owners

## Overview
This project aims to develop a **web application** that helps small business owners compare prices of groceries and wholesale goods across major retailers like Costco, Sam’s Club, Restaurant Depot, BJs, and Jetro. The app will initially focus on three staple items—eggs, milk, and bread—but is designed to scale to include any product. It leverages **web scraping** for initial data collection, **user contributions** for ongoing updates, and **AI-driven validation** to ensure accuracy.

## Features
### Core Features
1. **Price Comparison**:  
   - Compare prices for eggs, milk, and bread across multiple retailers.  
   - Display prices in standardized units (e.g., price per dozen eggs).  

2. **User-Submitted Updates**:  
   - Allow users to submit price updates manually or via receipt uploads.  
   - AI validates submissions for accuracy and flags anomalies.  

3. **AI-Powered Insights**:  
   - **Price Trend Prediction**: Forecast future price changes.  
   - **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggest deals based on user behavior.  
   - **Chatbot Assistance**: Answer user queries (e.g., “Where’s the cheapest milk today?”).  

4. **Web Scraping for Initial Data**:  
   - Scrape prices from retailer websites to populate the app with initial data.

   - Web scraping scripts gather prices for eggs, milk, and bread from target retailers.  
   - Data is standardized and stored in the database.  

2. **Ongoing Updates**:  
   - Users submit price updates, which are validated and stored.
