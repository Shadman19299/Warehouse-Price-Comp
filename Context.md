# **Context File for MVP Development**

## **Project Overview**
The goal is to build a **price comparison web application** that helps small business owners and daily customers in New York City compare prices of groceries (initially eggs, milk, and bread) across wholesale retailers (e.g., Costco, Sam’s Club) and local shops. The MVP will focus on core functionality, with future scalability in mind.

## **Key Features for MVP**
1. **Price Comparison**:  
   - Display prices for eggs, milk, and bread across multiple retailers.  
   - Standardize units (e.g., price per dozen eggs).  

2. **User-Submitted Updates**:  
   - Allow users to submit price updates manually.  

3. **Search Functionality**:  
   - Basic search bar to find products.  

4. **Web Scraping for Initial Data**:  
   - Scrape prices from retailer websites to populate the app with initial data.

## **Wireframes**
### **1. Homepage**
- **Search Bar**: Prominent search bar with autocomplete for product names.  
- **Featured Comparisons**: Display prices for eggs, milk, and bread in a table.  
- **Retailer Filters**: Allow users to filter by retailer (e.g., Costco, Sam’s Club).  

### **2. Product Comparison Page**
- **Comparison Table**: Columns for Retailer, Price, Unit, and Last Updated.  
- **Submit Price Update Button**: Allow users to submit new prices.  

### **3. Mobile-Friendly Design**
- Ensure all components are responsive and optimized for mobile devices.

## **Data Flow**
1. **Initial Data Collection**:  
   - Scrape prices for eggs, milk, and bread from Costco and Sam’s Club.  
   - Store data in PostgreSQL with the following schema:  
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE products (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(255),
       unit VARCHAR(50)
     );

     CREATE TABLE retailers (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(255)
     );

     CREATE TABLE prices (
       product_id INT REFERENCES products(id),
       retailer_id INT REFERENCES retailers(id),
       price DECIMAL(10,2),
       last_updated TIMESTAMP
     );
     ```

2. **User-Submitted Updates**:  
   - Allow users to submit prices via a form.  
   - Store submissions in the `prices` table with a `user_submitted` flag.  

3. **Display Data**:  
   - Fetch and display prices in a sortable table on the frontend.

## **MVP Deliverables**
### **Day 1: Setup & Scraping**
- Set up the project repository (GitHub/GitLab).  
- Develop web scraping scripts for Costco and Sam’s Club.  
- Populate the database with initial data for eggs, milk, and bread.  

### **Day 2: Backend Development**
- Build REST API endpoints:  
  - `GET /api/prices?product=eggs` → Fetch prices for a product.  
  - `POST /api/prices` → Accept user-submitted prices.  
- Set up PostgreSQL database and connect it to the backend.  

### **Day 3: Frontend Development**
- Create the homepage with a search bar and featured comparisons.  
- Build the product comparison page with a table and submit button.  
- Connect the frontend to the backend API.  

### **Day 4: Testing & Deployment**
- Test the app for functionality and responsiveness.  
- Deploy the frontend to Vercel and backend to Heroku.  
- Perform a final review and fix any bugs.

## **Future Scalability**
1. **AI Integration**:  
   - Add anomaly detection for user submissions.  
   - Implement price trend predictions.  

2. **Advanced Features**:  
   - Price alerts, bulk comparisons, and personalized recommendations.  

3. **Expansion**:  
   - Add more products, retailers, and locations.
